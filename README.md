# This is a work in progress!

At the moment, this is a work created to attempt to mitigate the problem of undergraduate Computer Science
and Software Engineering Students entering CSC-360 without (through no fault of their own) a working 
familiarity of core tools such as Make, Git and Linux. 

## Future Work...

Time providing, this handbook will be extended to offer additional chapters for course content that might be harder
to explain without visual examples. Generally, the goal is to cover course concepts through a hands-on and visual 
approach.

### Reviewers

This work would not be possible without the review of my colleagues and mentors, in whose debt I find myself nearly
perpetually. I'd like to offer a big thank-you to the following amazing people in no particular order - and a few others that do not wish
to have their name shared on the big scary interwebs:

+ Dr. Amir Baharloo
+ Jonathan Warawa
